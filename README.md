This is Money Counter, a basic money counter built in Godot 4.5.1. You can count coins and cash with it, you add and subtract how much of each coin and cash you have and when you have a lot of a specific thing you can also press on the button in between the plus and minus symbol and there you can manually set a specific value. The app built with Godot also features a save and load system. Money Counter is under the MIT license. *Made with love*
